<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Faiyaz Ansari and I come from Pune. I am currently pursuing my engineering degree in AI & Data Science from 
  Aissms's Institute of Information Technolog. I am interested in problem solving and practice DSA questions regularly.
  I want to become a software developer so I am learning full stack web development. I have made minor projects using html and have uploaded
  them on Github. I have previously interned at Teach For India as an engagement volunteer where I taught students of class 6
  and tracked their progress to help them achieve mastery in sixth standard English and Math. Currntly I am looking for internships
  to level up my skills and get my hand on real industry projects and gain insights into how things work in the corporate sector.
