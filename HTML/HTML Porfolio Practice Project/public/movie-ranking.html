<h1>The Best Movies According to Faiyaz</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>Harry Potter is my all-time favourite Hollywood movie. 
    When I was in class 8, I used to read the books 
    first and then watch the movies. It would be so
    fascinating to watch the characters act the way the author
    i.e. J.K. Rowling wanted them to. Today when I watch them, 
    it brings back the nostalgia
    of my school days.

<h3>Fantastic Beasts</h3>
<p>Fantastic Beasts is a 3 part series which is a
    prequel to the Harry Potter franchise. This series
    tells us about the wizarding world before the era of
    Harry Potter. It is a must waqtch for Harry Potter fans.
</p>

<h3>Bajrangi Bhaijaan</h3>
<p>This is a Bollywood movie played by Salman Khan. The message
    that the movie gives is truly inspiring. It tells us how a man
    by the name of Pawan who is a hindu devotee goes out of his
    way to reunite a muslim girl with her mother who lost her
    during her visit to India.
