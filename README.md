# Web-Development

Here, I have written codes in HTML, CSS and Javascript while learning and practising web development. I will also be adding
mini projects that I make using these languages and other technologies including but not limited to ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB as and when I am learning the concepts.
Feel free to check this out and suggest any changes that you feel might improve this repository.

Happy coding !!!
